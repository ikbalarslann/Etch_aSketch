what i want ?

- i have a container div with a loop i want to create square shape divs and fit all of them inside of the container div.
- i already created the container div now i need to create the other divs with the loop.
- 


what is the problem ?
- i want to have padding inside of the grids and in the border it can stay same thickness but if it is overlaps i need to decrease the tickness to half of it so i can actually have a grid .
